Domain wording
A Competition represents a football league (e.g. Premiere League) or a tournament (e.g. FA-Cup) or a combination of both (e.g. Champions League, having playoffs, a group stage and knock-out rounds). All Competitions can be accessed via a particular id or a human readable code. A Competition consists of Seasons, that hold a number of scheduled games named Matches. A certain number of Teams participate in one particular Season. Since v2 there's even more Resources: Persons appear in squads and lineups as Players and Coaches or in matches as Referees. See all Resources listed on the left and click for example responses and available filters.
